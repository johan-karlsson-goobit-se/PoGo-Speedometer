PoGo Speedometer displays your average speed over the last minute, based on GPS readings, as a notification in your status bar.

It calculates the speed in the same way as PoGo egg hatching, that is, it calculates your average speed from where you were a minute ago.

As long as this app always shows an average speed of below 10.5 km/h, all your distance should be counted towards eggs and buddy candy.

The app is completely free and open-source. It is developed by Johan "mlg" Karlsson, but based heavily on the app Status-Bar-Tachometer by Roland Meyer (rmy.ch) (Original sources: https://github.com/Waboodoo/Status-Bar-Tachometer ).

Known bugs:
 * Moving the phone to landscape mode or back resets the tracking
 * The speed shown in the notification area is missing it's decimal point (eg, 50 means 5.0, 105 means 10.5)
